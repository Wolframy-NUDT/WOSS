PLEASE NOTE : no super-user credentials are needed for any of these installations.

The current WOSS version has the following compatibilities:
  -   Acoustic Toolbox: 31 March 2019
  -   HDF5 library: v1.8.13
  -   NetCDF C library: v4.7.3
  -   NetCDF4 C++ library: v4.3.1
  -   GEBCO databases: 1D and 2D, 2008, 2014 and 2019
 
Requirements
 
  -   Download the recommended Acoustic Toolbox library from http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/woss/files/at.zip
      and follow installation instructions. The directory path that contains
      the binaries should be in the $PATH environment.
  -   woss::BellhopArrSyntax::BELLHOP_CREATOR_ARR_FILE_SYNTAX_1 is compliant with Bellhop arr file 
      syntax of the acoustic toolbox library up until the 16 Aug 2016 version.
  -   woss::BellhopArrSyntax::BELLHOP_CREATOR_ARR_FILE_SYNTAX_2 is compliant with Bellhop arr file 
      syntax of the acoustic toolbox library >= 31 March 2019 version. 
      This is the new factory value. 
  -   WOSS is now requiring NetCDF4 with HDF5 support in order to be able to read the latest GEBCO 2019 dataset.
  -   IF you wish to compile NetCDF4 software features, download the recommended HDF5, NetCDF library for C and 
      the C++4 from 
      - http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/woss/files/hdf5-1.8.13.tar.gz
      - http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/woss/files/netcdf-c-4.7.3.tar.gz
      - http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/ns/woss/files/netcdf-cxx4-4.3.1.tar.gz
      HDF5 and NetCDF4 have to be built with support for dynamic libraries. 
      Please refer to NetCDF documentation for comprehensive set of installation instructions. 
      Please note that the option --prefix is strongly suggested.
      A simple installation script is given here as example: 
          - install the HDF5 library with
            - ./configure --enable-shared --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path>
            - make
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
          - install the NETCDF C library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path> --disable-dap --enable-shared --enable-netcdf-4 CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/lib"
            - make 
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
          - install the NETCDF4 C++ library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf4_install_path> --enable-shared CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<optional_netcdf4_install_path>/lib"
            - make
            - make check
            - make install (should any test fail, based on test failure severity you could still give the install command)
  -   IF you want to compile NS-Miracle features download the latest version of NS2 allinone and of NS-Miracle 
      from the official git repository as instructed here:
      http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/pages/read/58/
      Read documentation provided in the above link for installation instructions.
  -   If you want to use WOSS with world data, download and extract the provided databases. 
      Download the GEBCO 2019 2D Fifteen seconds zip archive from https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/open_download/gebco/GEBCO_15SEC/zip/
      or any of the previous datasets from https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/historical_data_sets
      and put them in the same directory.


How to install WOSS library

  1) extract the compressed file in a directory of your choice;
  2) open a terminal and cd into that directory;
  3) run ./autogen.sh 
  4) run ./configure with the following options:
        --with-ns-allinone=<ns2-allinone_path> (optional)
        --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle_path> (optional)
        --with-netcdf4=<NetCDF4_installation_path> (optional, the same mentioned in the Requirements section, if NetCDF4
                                                  was installed with no --prefix, the default path SHOULD be
                                                  /usr/local)
        --with-pthread (optional but recommended)
        --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed> (optional)
           this path should be the same one used with NS-Miracle installation.
           Please refer to NS-Miracle documentation for more info
  5) run make
  6) run make install
