PLEASE NOTE : no super-user credentials are needed for any of these installations.

Requirements
 
  -   Download and install the latest Bellhop program from 
      http://oalib.hlsresearch.com/Modes/AcousticsToolbox 
      The directory path that contains the binaries should be in the $PATH environment.
  -   IF you want to compile NetCDF software features download the latest NetCDF library for C and 
      the legacy C++ from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp 
      NetCDF has to be built with support for dynamic libraries and with no support for HDF. 
      Please refer to NetCDF documentation for comprehensive set of installation instructions. 
      Please note that the option --prefix is strongly suggested.
      A simple installation script is given here as example: 
          - install the NETCDF C library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf_install_path> --disable-dap --enable-shared
            - make check install
          - install the NETCDF C++ library with
            - ./configure --prefix=<optional_netcdf_install_path> --enable-shared CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I<netcdf_c_src_path>/include" LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L<optional_netcdf_install_path>/lib"
            - make check install
  -   IF you want to compile NS-Miracle features download the latest version of NS2 allinone and of NS-Miracle 
      from the official SVN repository as instructed here:
      http://telecom.dei.unipd.it/pages/read/58/
      Read documentation provided in the above link for installation instructions.
  -   If you want to use WOSS with world data, download and extract the provided databases. 
      Register yourself and download the GEBCO_08 Grid and/or the GEBCO One Minute Grid database from:
      http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/
      and put it in the same directory.

How to install WOSS library

  1) extract the compressed file in a directory of your choice;
  2) open a terminal and cd into that directory;
  3)  run ./autogen.sh 
  4)  run ./configure with the following options:
        --with-ns-allinone=<ns2-allinone_path> (optional)
        --with-nsmiracle=<ns-miracle_path> (optional)
        --with-netcdf=<NetCDF_installation_path> (optional, the same mentioned in the Requirements section, if NetCDF 
                                                  was installed with no --prefix, the default path SHOULD be
                                                  /usr/local)
        --with-pthread (optional and useless unless a multi-core processor is installed)
        --prefix=<path_where_libraries_will_be_installed> (optional)
           this path should be the same one used with NS-Miracle installation.
           Please refer to NS-Miracle documentation for more info
  5) run make
  6) run make install
